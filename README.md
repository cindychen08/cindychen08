Hi, I’m Cindy Chen, and my partner Manon Denux!
We are interested in helping the environment and hydroponics system.
At the moment we are working our our multi-level sustainable hydroponic system!
This is a site where we will be sharing our progress and updating you on our plants and hydroponic system. 
You can also learn more about hydroponics and our goal on this website too. 
You can reach me at cindy.chen@smus.ca.
I hope you have a great day!
